NAVA TEST

Very limited on time (3 hours) so didn't set up the Node Express server. Clicking the name or description sends you to the Github link to know more about the repo. Given more time I could have pulled some key information out and presented it in e.g. a popup or expanded table like accordion.

I beleive webpack is already in create-react-app and the config file is in node modules somewhere. The app will be deployable by building it "npm run build". I have been using firebase for hosting so setup up a config file and deploy with a single command. 

For CSS Frameworks I have used Bootstrap and Material UI which I could have integrated as well given more time.

I will try and write a simple test for the API before my interview.
